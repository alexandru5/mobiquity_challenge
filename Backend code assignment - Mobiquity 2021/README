# 0 Problem
You want to send your friend a package with different things. Each thing you put inside the package has such parameters
as index number, weight and cost. The package has a weight limit. Your goal is to determine which things to put into the
package so that the total weight is less than or equal to the package limit and the total cost is as large as possible.
You would prefer to send a package which weighs less in case there is more than one package with the same price.

Input example
81 : (1,53.38,€45) (2,88.62,€98) (3,78.48,€3) (4,72.30,€76) (5,30.18,€9) (6,46.34,€48)

# 1 Solution
As this is a knaspack problem a little bit twisted I go with a dynamic solution and in order to do that
the weight of the package will be multiplied by 100. Because they're not so many items to pick up from (MAX 15)
it won't consume to much memory. As number of items and/or item's weight would increase this solution would cause
problems as a matrix of size NO_OF_ITEMS x WEIGHT * 100 is created.

After creating the matrix we iterate through it and for current step we check if weights is greater than capacity
from current step and if not for current step we maximize profit.

# 2 Java Implementation
The Solution has two models Item that represent the object from package and TestCase that contains data for a scenario.
So for both of them I used builder design pattern obtain with @Builder annotation from lombok. Also used different
annotations from them as @Getter and @Setter as they make code cleaner and easy to understand.

For input and output files we have FileReader class with two static methods that loads content from file into structures.
This class uses the Parser in order to parse content from file and load it into objects. In it we also have two methods
one that parse and loads an item and the other for a test case in which it loads test case max capacity and its items.

The Solver class contains the solution of the challenge as well as the result. After the result is computed we go
backwards through the items matrix from the resulted capacity and check if the weight matches.

Also created a LogEvent enum in which there are
# 3 Testing
For testing I created unit tests for each class. For item and test cases we tests that the builder works and object
is returned and also have test cases for different negative scenarios that occurs for constraints. For the log events
we are testing only that the value of the errors messages matches.
For Parser and FileReader we have different negative scenarios if the file content is incorrect or if file is empty
either if it has characters in it.
For the solver test we check that the result computed by the solver matches the solution from the output file.
